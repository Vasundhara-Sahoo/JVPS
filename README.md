## 🧠 Project Overview

In many rural areas, timely access to healthcare is limited, leading to delayed diagnoses and reduced treatment quality.  
Our solution is an "AI-powered chatbot" that:
- Interactively assesses basic symptoms
- Suggests potential diagnoses
- Recommends nearby healthcare centers for further care

The chatbot is multilingual, lightweight, and mobile-friendly — designed for accessibility even in low-resource settings.
